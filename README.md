Sept 19 - we have Pycharm Community installed and started with [lesson1](http://www.diveintopython3.net/your-first-python-program.html) .  
I added the folder [./StudyCode](./StudyCode) which we can save our stuff in and share as we move through lessons.  prefix your python code with initials.

Sept 27 - we studied [Chapter 2: Native Datatypes](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html) and read through to sectoin 2.4.7 leaving [2.5](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html#tuples) to continue on our own.  We did not write any code in this section, just tested snippets at the command line.
